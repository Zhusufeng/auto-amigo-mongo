# Auto Amigo Mongo

This is a small project to refresh my memory on MongoDB and Mongoose.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This uses Next 13, but to get started quicker, it used the pages API (instead of the new app router and server components).

It referenced the [MongoDB with Mongoose example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mongodb-mongoose) but leverages SWR more and uses TypeScript.

## Tech

- React & Next.js
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- TypeScript
- SWR
- Axios

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
